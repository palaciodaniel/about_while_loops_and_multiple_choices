# Channard's Psychosis Inventory

The idea behind this project was to be able to recreate a multiple-choice test on a Jupyter Notebook file, along with becoming comfortable with matplotlib and Seaborn, two Data Visualization libraries from Python. 

Also, my original intention was to use an actual psychometric test, but in the end I ruled out the idea to avoid potential copyright infringements. This basically means that this test is not meant to be taken seriously at all, and it was just created for demonstrative purposes as well. Still, feel free to use it to judge the scope of my English vocabulary (I'm not a native speaker) and my imagination.

Though, given the way I wrote the code, it wouldn't be that hard to extrapolate it to a real psychometric test if one day something like that was worthwhile.

## Instructions

Just load the .ipynb file on a Jupyter Notebook and run it. The test might take from two to five minutes to complete. There aren't neither correct nor wrong answers; it only measures the gravity of a fictitious psychotic diagnosis.
